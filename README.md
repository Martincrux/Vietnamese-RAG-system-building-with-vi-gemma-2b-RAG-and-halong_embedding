## Vietnamese RAG System with vi-gemma-2b-RAG and halong_embedding

This repository provides a comprehensive guide and code examples for building a Vietnamese Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system using the `vi-gemma-2b-RAG` language model and `halong_embedding` for semantic search. 

**What is RAG?**

RAG is a powerful technique that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches in natural language processing. It retrieves relevant information from a knowledge base and uses it as context for a generative language model to produce more accurate and informative responses.

**This repository features:**

* **Step-by-step tutorials:** Learn how to build a Vietnamese RAG system from scratch using Google Colab (.ipynb files).
* **Local execution code:** Download and run the RAG system locally on your machine (.py files).
* **Detailed explanations:** Understand the code and concepts behind building a RAG system with clear comments and explanations.
* **Example data:** Explore a sample dataset and learn how to prepare your own data for RAG.

**Key components:**

* **vi-gemma-2b-RAG:** A powerful Vietnamese language model fine-tuned for question answering and text generation.
* **halong_embedding:** A pre-trained Vietnamese sentence embedding model for semantic search and document retrieval.

**Getting started:**

1. **Explore the tutorials:** Start with the `.ipynb` files in the repository to learn the basics of RAG and how to implement it using Google Colab.
2. **Run the code locally:** Use the `.py` files to download the necessary models and run the RAG system on your local machine.
3. **Customize and experiment:** Adapt the code and data to build your own Vietnamese RAG system for various applications like question answering, chatbot development, and more.
